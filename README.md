# Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Good README Generator

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The application will be invoked with the following command:

```
node index.js
```

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. They will then be prompted with questions about their project.

The README will be populated with the following:

* At least one badge
* Project title
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributing
* Tests
* Questions
  * User GitHub profile picture
  * User GitHub email


```
